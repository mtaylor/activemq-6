<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<h2>Starting the Broker</h2>

<b>Note (Windows users):</b> The broker currently does not support spaces in path names.  For this reason the broker should be placed in a directory with no spaces in it's absolute path.</br></br>

<b>Note (Windows users):</b> Examples below use the shell script `activemq` for use with linux, Windows users should use the `activemq.cmd` script with the same parameters.</br></br>

To run the ActiveMQ broker with the default configuration, run the command shown below from the "bin" directory.</br></br>

$ ./activemq run</br></br>

To specify a broker configuration file:</br></br>

$ ./activemq run --config scheme:location</br></br>

e.g.</br></br>

$ ./activemq run --config xml:/home/activemq/bootstrap.xml</br></br>

The distribution ships with a number of example configurations that can be used to get started.  You can find these under the "config" directory.</br></br>

It is possible to configure run time paramters in the activemq.conf (activemq.conf.bat for windows) file under the "bin" directory.
<h2>Stopping the Broker</h2>

To stop the broker please use the activemq script:</br></br>

$ ./activemq stop</br></br>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

The broker comes shipped with an in depth user manual and a bunch of examples to help you get started.  The manual is accessible from the broker website.  Start the broker then navigate to the <a href="http://localhost:8161">Apache ActiveMQ</a>.</br></br>

The examples are shipped inside the distribution folder under "examples": <a href="./examples/index.html">Apache ActiveMQ Examples</a>.</br></br>
