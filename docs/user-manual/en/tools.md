# Tools

ActiveMQ ships with several helpful command line tools. All tools are
available from the activemq-tools-\<version\>-jar-with-dependencies.jar.
As the name suggests, this Java archive contains ActiveMQ along with all
of its dependencies. This is done to simplify the execution of the tools
by eliminating the need so specify a classpath. These tools are:

-   **`print-data`**. Used for low-level inspection of the bindings and
    message journals. It takes two parameters - `bindings-directory` and
    `journal-directory`. These are the paths to the directories where
    the bindings and message journals are stored, respectively. For
    example:

        java -jar activemq-tools-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar print-data /home/user/activemq/data/bindings /home/user/activemq/data/journal

-   **`print-pages`**. Used for low-level inspection of paged message
    data. It takes two parameters - `paging-directory` and
    `journal-directory`. These are the paths to the directories where
    paged messages and the message journals are stored, respectively.
    For example:

        java -jar activemq-tools-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar print-pages /home/user/activemq/data/paging-directory /home/user/activemq/data/journal

-   **`export`**. Used for exporting all binding and message data
    (including paged and large messages) as well as JMS destinations and
    connection factories (including JNDI bindings). The export is
    structured as XML. This data can then be imported to another server
    even if the server is a different version than the original. It
    takes 4 parameters:

    -   `bindings-directory` - the path to the bindings directory.

    -   `journal-directory` - the path to the journal directory.

    -   `paging-directory` - the path to the paging directory.

    -   `large-messages-directory` - the path to the large-messages
        directory.

    Here's an example:

        java -jar activemq-tools-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar export /home/user/activemq/data/bindings-directory /home/user/activemq/data/journal-directory /home/user/activemq/data/paging-directory /home/user/activemq/data/large-messages

    This tool will export directly to standard out so if the data needs
    to be stored in a file please redirect as appropriate for the
    operation system in use. Also, please note that the `export` tool is
    single threaded so depending on the size of the journal it could
    take awhile to complete.

-   **`import`**. Used for importing data from an XML document generated
    by the `export` tool. The `import` tool reads the XML document and
    connects to a ActiveMQ server via Netty to import all the data. It
    takes 5 parameters:

    -   `input-file` - the path to the XML file generated by the
        `export` tool.

    -   `host` - the IP address or hostname of the server where the data
        should be imported.

    -   `port` - the port where ActiveMQ is listening.

    -   `transactional` - a `boolean` flag to indicate whether or not to
        send all the *message* data in a single transaction. Valid
        values are `true` or `false`.

    -   `application-server-compatibility` - a `boolean` flag to
        indicate whether or not JNDI bindings need special treatment to
        account for the way JBoss AS7, Wildfly, and JBoss EAP 6 handle
        JNDI for remote clients. Each of these application servers
        require a special JNDI binding to allow access from remote
        clients. If this is `true` then every JNDI binding in the XML
        will be duplicated in the "java:jboss/exported/" namespace thus
        allowing both local and remote clients to use the same name when
        accessing resources via JNDI. Valid values are `true` or
        `false`.

    Here's an example:

        java -jar activemq-tools-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar import /home/user/exportData.xml 127.0.0.1 61616 false false

    Like the `export` tool the `import` tool is single threaded so
    depending on the size of the XML file it may take awhile for the
    process to complete.
